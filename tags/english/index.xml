Movement of pendulum is recorded by camera and fitted on Matlab It takes several hours to wait until the pendulum setting down: it seems damping accidently due to external force. We got perfect data of oscillation and fitted by fourier function on the last day.</description></item><item><title>Sports is Life</title><link>https://darknessyzy.github.io/en/1/01/01/sports-is-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://darknessyzy.github.io/en/1/01/01/sports-is-life/</guid><description> Fencing &amp;#39;Champions&amp;#39; With Coach Tim Robinson and my teammate Jack Bennett!
