Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\
And sorry I could not travel both\
And be one traveler, long I stood\
And looked down one as far as I could\
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,\
And having perhaps the better claim,\
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\
Though as for that the passing there\
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay\
In leaves no step had trodden black.\
Oh, I kept the first for another day!\
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh\
Somewhere ages and ages hence:\
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”\
I took the one less traveled by,\
And that has made all the difference.
